# Image_Forgery_Detection
This research investigated the effectiveness of various deep learning models for image forgery detection. A custom Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model alongside transfer learning approaches utilizing pre-trained VGG16, ResNet50, and MobileNetV2 architectures were explored. The models were evaluated on a dataset of forged and authentic images, and their performance was compared using metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall. The results demonstrated that all models achieved promising levels of accuracy in classifying forged images.
